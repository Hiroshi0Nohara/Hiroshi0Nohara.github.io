            We collect our meat mainly from morgues. <br> We won't tell you which country(ies).
            But we can say road accidents are our guilty pleasures. <br>   Death is not lazy. <br> <br> 

<h2> Guarantees</h2> 
            <br> All of our products are found and verified by some professional, medical examiner, med students, thanatopractors and their assistants, etc. <br> <br>

<h2> Morality</h2> 
            As passionate people, we think everyone should taste human once in his or her life. 
       <br><br>     Because it's <strong>yourself</strong>. <br> <br> It's <strong>knowledge</strong>. <br>
            <br> We deeply think eating human is not immoral, as long as we don't kill them. <br> <br>
